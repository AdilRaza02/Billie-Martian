    "Lack of Oxygen",
    "No sun radiation shields",
    "Limited water resources",
    "Short supply of food due to harsh weather conditions",
    "Phycological issues",
    "Living far away from Earth"

  "hmw_question": "How might we make our Martian employees general environment similar to the Earth using resources available on Mars?",
  "solutions": [
    "As carbondioxide is mostly found on Mars, we could develop a mask which strips carbon and liberates oxygen",
    "Restricted zones covered with radiation filters to simulate exposure of radiations found on Earth",
    "Mars is filled with ice, the filtering radiation mechanism can help produce heat to melt the ice and covert it to consumable water",
    "Greenhouse formation with controlled atmosphere to grow plants would be an option as Mars has similar day/night concept we see living on Earth",
    "Community-based efforts and participation to resolve all basic necessary day-to-day challenges "
